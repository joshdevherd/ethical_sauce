# ethical_sauce
A blog site about ethical concepts using HTML, CSS, jQuery and MaterializeCSS framework. This website is aimed to be fully responsive for mobile use - it also has a lighthouse score of 85.25 as is responsive and has accessability considerations applied it it. It also has an SEO score of 97 / 100. Additionally, I have incorporated PHP on the contact page so messages are sent to my email (to be changed to blog email once up and running).

For the icons, I mostly used Google Font icons, though for the social icons, these are from Font Awesome. Images, other than the top index banner are placeholders

This is a design project and I am yet to add PHP for products from my MySQL database and add PHP to the contact page.
